          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Founded in 2023, our platform began with a simple question: Why do we waste so much food when so many go hungry?
            The contradiction was stark - restaurants, events, and households throwing away perfectly good food while millions struggle to find their next meal.
          </p>
          <p>
            We started by connecting a few local restaurants with nearby shelters, and from there, our network grew.
            Today, we're proud to work with hundreds of food donors and recipient organizations across India,
            redistributing what would have been wasted to those who need it most.

              <h3>Food Wastage</h3>
              <p>
                India wastes approximately 68.7 million tons of food every year,
                worth about â‚¹92,000 crores. This happens at farms, processing facilities,
                distribution, retail, and in our homes.

              <h3>Hunger Crisis</h3>
              <p>
                Despite being one of the world's largest food producers,
                India is home to 194 million undernourished people -
                about 14% of our population struggles with hunger daily.

              <h3>Environmental Impact</h3>
              <p>
                Food waste in landfills produces methane, a greenhouse gas 25 times
                more potent than CO2. Food waste accounts for 8-10% of global
                greenhouse gas emissions.
